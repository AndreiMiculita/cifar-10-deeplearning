Comparison between state of the art computer vision models. Three popular models AlexNet, VGG and ResNet; similar but different in many perspectives were put into the test. The task was image classification.

Rather than exploring many different hyper parameter settings for every model, we performed tests using three different Optimization methods while employing six different activation functions as well as performing regularization with $L^2$-Norm (weight decay). Every train run was timed and an overview of the computational time across all setups was produced.
